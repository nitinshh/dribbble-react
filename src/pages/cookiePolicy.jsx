          <p className="terms-paragraph">
            Cookies: A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a
            website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on
            your device in order to remember information about you, such as your
            language preference or login information. Those cookies are set by
            us and called “first-party cookies”. We also use “third-party
            cookies” – which are cookies originating from a domain different
            from the domain of the website you are visiting (e.g., one of our
            Sites) – generally for our advertising and marketing efforts. More
            specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the
            following purposes: to enable our Sites to function and maintain
            security (for example, shopping cart functionality, security,
            customer support); to track, measure, and improve performance of our
            Sites; allow personalization of our Sites; and to target our own ads
            to prior visitors of our Sites on third party websites (see below on
            “Why We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies”). A persistent cookie
            remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent
            cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to one of
            our Sites until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically
            delete themselves at expiration. Persistent cookies can be removed
            by following your web browsers directions. A session cookie is
            temporary and disappears after you close your browser. A third-party
            cookie is placed by someone other than the Whatever Group, and may
            gather browsing activity across multiple websites and across
            multiple sessions. They are usually a type of persistent cookie and
            are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time
            set in each third-party cookie. You can reset your web browser to
            refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
            However, some features of our service may not function properly if
            the ability to accept cookies is disabled. For more information
